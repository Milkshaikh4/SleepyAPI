### Communication and Agile Development Workflow

Our team has been working together for two years now and as such have a firm grasp on our strengths and weaknesses. In that time we have developed strategies for effective communication, delegation of responsibilities and overall workflow. We see this as a huge benefit, as knowing how the rest of the group operates aided our efficiency and workflow. This was one of the primary reason we decided to stay together as a group for this workshop.

Since we used **GitHub** for our project, we also made use of a Kanban board under the *GitHub Projects* tab to keep track of agile sprint tasks as well as project and sprint backlogs. Other tasks relating to the reports were written in the report document itself as a checklist. Task delegation was handled according to our respective roles within the team, and overflow in that section was thus delegated accordingly. Each deliverable was classified as a 'sprint', and at the beginning of a sprint all the requirements and tasks needed for that deliverable were created as issues in the project Kanban.

Additionally, we communicated regularly via **Facebook Messenger** to discuss our next steps and update each other on our progress. We also had weekly in-person meetings separate to our mentoring sessions which occur immediately after our mentoring timeslot, specifically Wednesday 10:20 am-12:00 pm. In this time, we worked together on any tasks from the week before that had yet to be completed, and tried to get a headstart on the workload for the week ahead. The meetings functioned as an impromptu stand-up meeting, where we were able to make sure everyone was on the same page, performed quick demos of our current progress and clarified any questions/concerns that any members had.

We also took the time to collectively look at the Kanban board in order to see if there was a large backlog that needed attention. Other small meetings were also be held during the week, usually on a Monday or Friday, if the team felt there was a need for some extra group collaboration or there was something the group needed to work out in person.

**Slack** was also used as a project management tool. Slack allowed the team to have a collaborative messaging space for discussing ideas and issues in the project, and also allowed us to have separate chats regarding front-end and back-end development. It meant that ideas and potential fixes for bugs weren't lost in a large chat and were better directed at the members who will handle them.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Meet the team

Our team preferred to work with semi-rigid roles in place, meaning that if the overflow for a particular section of the project became too large, team members would be pulled from other sections to balance out the overflow workload. During normal workflows, these were the roles assigned to each team member:

|Name|Role|
|----|----------------|
|Bailey Ivancic|<br><ul><li>Team leader</li></ul><ul><li>Backend developer (Python, Flask, API)</li></ul><ul><li>Web crawler and API interface</li></ul><ul><li>Natural Language Processing</li></ul><ul><li>Google Trends and Twitter API integration</li></ul><ul><li>Design Information Report</li></ul>|
|Nabil Shaikh|<br><ul><li>Backend developer (Python, Flask)</li></ul><ul><li>Frontend developer (React)</ul></li><ul><li>Natural Language Processing</li></ul><ul><li>Google Trends and Twitter API integration</li></ul>|
|Harry Tang|<br><ul><li>Backend developer (Python, Flask)</li></ul><ul><li>Web crawler and API interface</ul></li><ul><li>Machine Learning</li></ul><ul><li>Design Information Report</li></ul>|

#### Why These Roles?

Bailey was recognised as the team leader due to his ability to manage and organise the team and the delegation of their tasks effectively. His experience with Python and Flask from previous projects made him an ideal member to assign the responsibility of developing the back-end for our API. As part of this responsibility, he also worked to integrate our API with our chosen web crawler, and set the foundations of our API interface - Bailey was the one that initially started working on the web crawler, and thus was the most knowledgeable of its usage. Following from this, he was therefore the best person (along with Harry) to be writing the Design Information report. Later on, Bailey also took on the responsibility of integrating our API with the Google Trends and Twitter APIs, working closely with Nabil to develop graphs and other such visualsations from this data in a summary page. Admirably, he also chose to tackle Natural Langauge processing using TextRazor. This was decided due to a divide-and-conquer mentality, since we knew we wanted to include both Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, and it was decided Harry would manage the Machine Learning. 

Nabil is a flexible team member with skills in both backend and frontend development. In the past, he was also a core member of the backend subteam, setting up and managing the Flask framework of our projects. However he had recently been committed to learning React, and subsequently encouraged the team to use it in place of HTML and CSS as a frontend tool. He was thus assigned the role of backend development, before leading the frontend development with his knowledge of React later on in the development timeline. As mentioned previously, Nabil also worked with Bailey to develop data visualisations for selected report data, integrated Google and Twitter APIs into our project and also took part in developing our Natural Language Processing feature. Since these tasks were linked closely with the frontend, Nabil was the best choice due to the flexibility of his skills.

Harry specialises in backend development, having been part of the backend subteam for past projects as well. He was focused on the gritty details other members tended to overlook, and was committed to asking all the right questions to ensure our API performed as seamlessly as possible, adhering to the project specifications. Since he was a core backend developer, he worked with Bailey on the Design Information Report, as they are the ones who planned and implemented the core functionality of the API (thus knowing how it work best). He also spearheaded the development of the Machine Learning aspect of our project, partly due to the aforementioned divide-and-conquer strategy of responsibility, but also because his previous experience in Machine Learning gave him an advantage the rest of us did not have.

Jacob has been known to switch between frontend and backend subteams depending on need and circumstance, however he leans towards the front-end based on preference. As such, he assisted Estella in the design of the project website interface, balancing this with the writing and maintenance of any and all reports required. He was also thorough in his testing methods and was often the one who reported bugs within the project if he could not resolve them himself. This lead him to be a part of the testing team, using Postman to develop scripts to ensure API responses were as expected. Lastly, since it was expected that he would have his hands free (or, his tasks would not be gruelling as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing), Jacob was also put in charge of writing the final report along with Estella. 

Estellaâ€™s development preferences lie within the visual design of the project and is adept at cleaning up basic templates started by the backend team into a user friendly interface. For this reason she was assigned the role of frontend developer and report writer. Since she spent a lot of time using the website, it was inevitable that she would encounter bugs regarding its performance, and consequently reported them to the backend subteam if she could not fix them herself. Like Jacob, this therefore lead her to also be a part of the testing team, as well as the other half of the final report writing duo.
